## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [level](./puppeteer.protocol.media.playermessage.level.md) | ('error' \| 'warning' \| 'info' \| 'debug') | Keep in sync with MediaLogMessageLevel We are currently keeping the message level 'error' separate from the PlayerError type because right now they represent different things, this one being a DVLOG(ERROR) style log message that gets printed based on what log level is selected in the UI, and the other is a representation of a media::PipelineStatus object. Soon however we're going to be moving away from using PipelineStatus for errors and introducing a new error type which should hopefully let us integrate the error log level into the PlayerError type.

|  [message](./puppeteer.protocol.media.playermessage.message.md) | string |  |
